**BatBar** is an ultra-minimalist battery indicator for Windows. 
It displays a 1-pixel-wide colored line on the edge of your screen, giving you an immediate, unobtrusive view of your battery level. 
Always visible, never distracting.

🖼️ **“Screenshot-safe"**: Thanks to its ultra-thin 1-pixel width, BatBar sits on the extreme edge of your screen — typically outside the active capture area used by most print screens.  
_You can still increase its width if needed, but 1px is the sweet spot for invisibility!_

**Ideal for streamers, designers, and screen recorders!**


## ✨ Features

- 🔋 **Instant visual feedback**: the height of the bar shows your battery level
- 📸 **Screenshot-safe**: invisible in most screenshots and screen recordings
- 🚦 **Intuitive color coding**: with standard green-orange-red & blue hints
- 📌 **Always on top**: stays above all windows
- 🖱️ **Adjustable width**: scroll the mouse wheel over the bar
- 🫥 **Non-intrusive design**: minimalist and out of the way

## 🚀 How It Works

The bar automatically appears on the right edge of your primary screen .

- **Adjust width**: `mouse wheel up/down` over the bar (1–10 px)
- **Close the bar**: `SHIFT + right-click` on the bar

## ⚡ Resource Usage

This utility is designed to be extremely lightweight:

- 📦 **Size**: Tiny 130KB compiled executable
- 💾 **Memory**: ~20MB RAM usage
- 🔄 **CPU**: < 0.1% idle, 0.1-0.3% during updates (every 5s)
- 🔋 **Battery Impact**: Negligible due to efficient polling
- 🚀 **Startup**: Instant launch, no dependencies

Runs silently in the background without impacting system performance.

## 🧠 Why BatBar?

Most battery indicators are cluttered, over-engineered or get in your - and your system resources' - way. 
**BatBar** focuses on pure function with an aesthetic that’s nearly invisible, also for your system. The solution for developers, creatives and minimalists who want instant battery awareness without distractions.
